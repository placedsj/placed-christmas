          'Climbing on icy roofs with electrical wires is inherently dangerous. Beyond falls, improper wiring can lead to electrical fires, shorts, or even electrocution. Statistics show that thousands of holiday-related accidents occur each year from DIY lighting installations.',

          '<strong>Electrical Risks:</strong> Overloaded circuits, improper GFCI protection, and mixing indoor/outdoor rated equipment create serious fire hazards.',

          '<strong>Hidden Costs:</strong> Replacement bulbs each year ($50-100), storage solutions ($50-200), potential repair costs from poor installation ($200-2000), and even medical bills from accidents (thousands).',
          '<strong>Time Investment:</strong> Planning (4-8 hours), shopping (4-6 hours), installation (8-16 hours), troubleshooting (2-8 hours), removal (4-8 hours), storage (2-4 hours). That\'s 24-50 hours of your holiday season!',
          '<strong>üéØ The PLACED Solution:</strong> We provide durable, commercial-grade, custom-cut LED lights designed to last for years.

          '<strong>Replacement Cycle:</strong> Most homeowners replace 30-50% of their lights every 2-3 years due to storage damage. That \'one-time\' investment keeps recurring.',
          '<strong>üéØ The PLACED Solution:</strong> All our clients benefit from professional, temperature-controlled, labeled storage. We meticulously pack away your lights, test them before next season, and ensure they\'re ready to glow again.

          '<strong>1. Ditch the Generic Strings:</strong> For a professional look, avoid pre-packaged stringer sets. Instead, use <strong>C7 or C9 bulk light line</strong> (empty socket wire) and screw in individual LED bulbs. This allows for custom lengths and perfect spacing.',
          '<strong>2. Measure Meticulously:</strong> Use online tools (like Google Earth or a satellite view app) to accurately measure your roofline, gutters, windows, and landscape features. Overestimate by 10-15% to ensure adequate wire length.',
          '<strong>3. Consistent Spacing is Key:</strong> Professional displays use consistent bulb spacing - typically 6", 9", or 12" apart depending on the application. Rooflines: 12" spacing. Windows: 6" spacing. Trees: 9" spacing for balanced coverage.',
          '<strong>4. Color Temperature Matters:</strong> Stick to one color temperature throughout your display. Warm white (2700K-3000K) creates cozy ambiance. Cool white (5000K-6500K) appears more modern and bright. Mixing temperatures looks unprofessional.',
          '<strong>5. Create a Lighting Plan:</strong> Sketch your home and mark power outlet locations, planned light runs, and calculate total wattage. This prevents mid-installation surprises and ensures you have adequate power distribution.'

          '<strong>Professional Clip Selection:</strong> Use the right clip for each application. All-in-one clips for shingles, gutter clips for gutters, magnetic clips for metal surfaces. Never use staples or nails through wires!',
          '<strong>The Custom Cable Advantage:</strong> Cut your light line to exact lengths needed. This eliminates excess wire loops and creates clean, professional lines. Use male/female connectors to join sections.',
          '<strong>The Pole Mounting Trick:</strong> For second-story applications, consider pole-mounted systems instead of roof mounting. Telescoping poles with light clips allow ground-based installation and adjustment.',
          '<strong>Power Distribution Strategy:</strong> Use outdoor-rated power strips with individual switches placed in weatherproof enclosures. This allows section control and easy troubleshooting.',
          '<strong>Wire Management:</strong> Secure all connections with waterproof wire nuts and electrical tape. Keep connections off the ground and away from walkways. Use cable ties to manage excess wire neatly.',
          '<strong>Testing Protocol:</strong> Test every section before final installation. Use a multimeter to check voltage at the end of long runs to ensure adequate power delivery.'

          '<strong>Load Calculations:</strong> Standard 15-amp circuit = 1800 watts maximum. LED lights typically use 0.5-2 watts per bulb. Calculate total wattage and leave 20% safety margin. Use multiple circuits for large displays.',
          '<strong>GFCI Protection is Non-Negotiable:</strong> All outdoor lighting circuits must have GFCI protection. Test GFCI outlets monthly during the season. Replace immediately if they fail to trip.',
          '<strong>UL Certification Matters:</strong> Only use UL-listed lights, extension cords, and electrical components rated for outdoor use. "For indoor use only" equipment can cause fires outdoors.',
          '<strong>Weather Considerations:</strong> Never install during precipitation or high winds. Allow lights to dry completely before storage. Use weatherproof connections rated for your climate.',
          '<strong>Ladder Safety Protocol:</strong> Use appropriate ladder type for the job. Maintain 3-point contact. Have a spotter. Never overreach. Consider scaffolding for extensive roofline work.',

          '<strong>Systematic Removal:</strong> Work in reverse order of installation. Remove bulbs first, then wire, then clips. This prevents tangling and damage. Take photos during removal to remember successful layouts for next year.',
          '<strong>Bulb Care:</strong> Remove LED bulbs from sockets before storing wire. Store bulbs in original packaging or egg cartons to prevent breakage. Sort by color and type for easy identification next season.',
          '<strong>Wire Management:</strong> Wrap light line around large spools or cardboard forms. Avoid tight coiling which can damage internal wires. Label each section with masking tape indicating location and length.',
          '<strong>Storage Environment:</strong> Use climate-controlled space if possible. Avoid attics, garages, or basements with extreme temperature swings. Moisture is the enemy - use desiccant packets in storage containers.',
